# [Jest - Javascript Testing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sofia-aguirre/jest-lesson/master/image.png)
Jest is a unit testing platform to test Javasript code and React apps (made by Facebook).

## Strengths
- It doesn't need configuration, provides ready-to-use tools for engineers to test their applications.
- Just put your tests in a directory, run it on your CLI and it begins tests!
- Snapshot testing ()
- Parallel testing by size not by date added
- Runs failed tests first so devs can get to work on those ASAP.
- Has API assertions library

```
"...something easy to understand, fast to setup, rock solid and well documented. Jest covers all four requirements we had. I totally recommend it."
```

## Weaknesses
- Quite new and little support.
- Works well with smaller projects, but not scalable. 
- Integration with other libraries can be difficult.
- Their tools may be out of the box, but there are not as many as more mature testing libraries like Mocha/Chai.
- Only just started working with Babel. 

## Opinion
Jest seems like an easy choice to implement testing for small apps and no experience necessary when you follow their documentation. It works out of the box, but there is not much support aside from the well-written documentation and there's also not much of a community. 
- If you do have experience with testing then it might be too limited for what you want to do.
- If you don't, it might be a good starting point.
